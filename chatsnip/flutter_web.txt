Web is just another target for Flutter, but sure you might want to implement few platform specific "changes" for it. Example being `SelectionArea` widget to replicate the experience of selecting text on the web.
You will find them once you try to make it work for web.
Other thing to keep in mind is not every packages for mobile works with web. So you will have to change them.
To get started if you haven't already `flutter create . --platform web` on your existing project (run it on the root)
And also `flutter config enable web` to enable web build for every future Flutter project you create.
